I received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from [School of Electric Power Engineering](https://dlx.njit.edu.cn/), [Nanjing Institute of Technology](https://www.njit.edu.cn/) in 2017, and the M.Sc. degree in power electronics and electric drive from [School of Automation](https://au.njust.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://www.njust.edu.cn/) in 2020. In 2025, I received the Ph.D degree in electrical engineering from [School of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/).
I am extraordinarily honored and grateful to have been supervised by Professor [Xiaohui Qu](https://seu.teacher.360eol.com/teacherBasic/preview?teacherId=10117) as my Ph.D. advisor and Professor [Kai Yao](http://202.119.85.163/open/TutorInfo.aspx?dsbh=IeR3poAW53o7PUstnhmXaQ==&yxsh=wx3VkFtexLA=&zydm=C0KH!bYnMa0=) as my M.Sc adviser.

From 2020 to 2021, I worked as a Hardware Engineer at DJI [(SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd.)](https://www.dji.com) in Shenzhen, where I was responsible for motor drive design for the [Avata](https://www.dji.com/cn/products/camera-drones#avata-series) series drones.

My current research interests include wireless power transfer, power factor correction converters, and motor drives.
